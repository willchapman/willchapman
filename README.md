 ## Hi, I'm Will Chapman

  Senior DevOps/Cloud Engineer focused on building reliable AWS platforms, automation, and secure delivery pipelines.

  ### 🔧 Focus
  - AWS architecture and operations
  - Terraform and infrastructure as code
  - Kubernetes and container platforms
  - CI/CD modernization
  - Serverless and event-driven workflows
  - Production reliability, incident response, and root cause analysis

  ### 📌 Selected Public Repositories
